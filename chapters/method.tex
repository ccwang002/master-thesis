\chapter{Methods}
\label{c:method}

In the following sections, first a number of typical RNA-Seq and DNA-Seq
pipelines that BioCloud supports are defined and explained. Then the design of
BioCloud is explained by breaking down into two main parts: the website and the
report generator. For the website, the components including account
registration, data sources management, experiment design, and pipeline
execution are described and their roles are illustracted in the website
overview workflow. For the report generator, the workflow demonstrates how
outputs are extracted, parsed, and rendered into pre-defined web-based report
templates.
