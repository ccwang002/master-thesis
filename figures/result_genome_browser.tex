        Result integration with genome browser. The alignment of HER2-1 sample
        was displayed on the UCSC genome browser. Display options for BAM file
        can be tuned in the configuration, as shown in (a). By clicking on an
        read, detail alignment information can be found in the new viewing
        pane, as shown in (b). In (c), the viewing pane was configured to
        display the coverage depth plot of HER2-1, HER2-2, NBS1, and NBS2
        samples simultaneously.
