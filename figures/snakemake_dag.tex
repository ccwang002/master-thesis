\caption[Example of DAG job dependencies of a Snakemake workflow]{
    Example of DAG job dependencies of a Snakemake workflow that first aligns
    sequence reads to genome using BWA MEM, sorts and indexes the aligned BAM
    file, and finally calls variants using bcftools. Two samples A and B are
    used, and Snakemake can correctly understand the input and output
    dependencies for each job through file expansion and collection rule. The
    workflow is obtained from
    \href{http://snakemake.bitbucket.org/snakemake-tutorial.html}
    {the official tutorial of Snakemake}.
