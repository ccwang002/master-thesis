    Example of custom RNA-Seq analysis pipeline design on Partek Flow. It first
    use gnome aligner STAR to align the sequencing, and then use Cufflinks
    quantify the transcript expression. Pre-alignment and post-alignment
    quality check are added. An alignment coverage report is added after
    alignment. The custom pipeline is obtained from
    \href{http://www.partek.com/star-align-and-quantify}{Partek Flow's official site}.
